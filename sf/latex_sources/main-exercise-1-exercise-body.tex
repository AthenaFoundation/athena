Give a constructive definition of a {\em precedence\/} relation on \smtt{Day}, call it \smtt{prec},
which holds between two days $d_1$ and $d_2$ iff $d_1$ comes ``before'' $d_2$.
Thus, for example, Monday should precede every day other than itself, but Thursday should not precede, say Tuesday.\footnote{More
precisely: If you were to assign an integer code $\temv{code}(d)$ between 1 and 7 to any day $d$ by mapping Monday to 1,
Tuesday to 2, and so on, then $d_1$ should precede $d_2$ iff $\temv{code}(d_1) < \temv{code}(d_2)$.}
Your definition should not use any auxiliary symbols other than those already defined above, and it should
pass all of the following tests:
\begin{tcAthena}
(eval Monday prec Tuesday)    # true
(eval Monday prec Wednesday)  # true
(eval Monday prec Thursday)   # true
(eval Monday prec Sunday)     # true
(eval Monday prec Monday)     # false
(eval Saturday prec Sunday)   # true
(eval Saturday prec Monday)   # false
(eval Saturday prec Friday)   # false
\end{tcAthena}
(\temv{Hint}: Use the function \smtt{next}.)
